                                - We have been given an opportunity to clean the temple. Our assigned dates are August 15th-19th from 9:15pm-11:15pm each day. We need 30+ volunteers for each day. I am sharing a sign up document and would encourage you to share this information with the adult current temple recommend holders in your ward. They are welcome to sign up for any and as many dates that they are available to serve in the temple.<br>
                                
                                - I need to hear back from each elders quorum president by August 7th to verify that we are fully covered for each day and to share this information with the temple. Volunteers should gather together at the southwest doors of the temple. <br>
                                
                                - They will all be let into the temple from 9:00pm - 9:15pm. Volunteers should dress in clothing as if they were attending the temple. They should bring a comfortable pair of shoes in which to stand and work for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. White clothing of all sizes and shoe covers will be provided.<br>
